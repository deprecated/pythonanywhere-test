* Trying out PythonAnywhere
First thoughts on trying out PythonAnywhere, which is a cloud-hosted
python environment and web hosting platform


** Motivation
+ I learned about PythonAnywhere from the [[http://www.talkpythontome.com][Talk Python to Me]] podcast
+ I am trying it out to see if it would be suitable to use for
  collaborating with students, etc
** Problems encountered

*** Browser compatibility
Tested on [2015-06-06 Sat]
| OS   | Browser       | Built-in editor | Type in console? | Copy/paste in console? |
|------+---------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------------|
| OS X | Safari        | Yes             | Yes              | No                     |
| OS X | Chrome        | Yes             | Yes              | Yes                    |
| iOS  | Mobile Safari | Yes             | No               | No                     |
| iOS  | Chrome        | Yes             | No               | No                     |
+ The only combination that works properly is Chrome on OS X
+ Safari on OS X works OK, except that I can't paste from the system
  clipboard.  Not even using the =Edit->Paste= menu item - it is
  greyed out.
+ On iOS (on an iPhone 5S) I can't get the consoles to work at all in
  either browser.  When you open a console, the on-screen keyboard
  never appears, so it is impossible to type anything.  The built-in
  file editor does work fine however.

*** Missing functionality

**** Old emacs version
Version 23.4.1 is installed, which around 2 years old - an eternity in emacs-dev time!

Installed version of org-mode is 6.33, which seems even more out of date.
For example, org-babel is not properly integrated

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(emacs-version)
#+end_src

+ [ ] Is it possible to install more recent version of org-mode?
+ Magit isn't installed either :(
  + But the generic =vc= commands work great
  + For instance =C-x v v= automatically does =git commit -a=, popping
    up a buffer for the commit message


**** Missing python packages
+ How easy is it to install these by hand?
+ Missing =astropy=

**** iPython notebooks
No obvious way to use these, which is odd since it would be a natural
fit with a web service.


** Other things to remember

*Note, the following are not bugs in PythonAnywhere.* They are either
intrinsic limitations of a web-based environment, or are issues
related to quirks of my personal set-up.  

*** Limitations of emacs run in a terminal
Emacs in a terminal works mostly the same as when run as a graphical
application.  But there are a few little foibles.

**** Missing keybindings
Some keybindings are lost to the vagaries of ansi terminal escape
codes, but most have working alternatives:
+ =M-RET= (=org-insert-heading=) doesn't work - use =ESC RET= instead
+ =C-/= (=undo=) doesn't work - use =C-_= instead
+ =C-v= (=scroll-up=) doesn't work (this might actually be a
  particular limitation of the PythonAnywhere terminal) - use =PgDn=
  instead, which is =Fn downarrow= on my MacBook keyboard.
**** Awful colors
+ The default color-scheme is migraine-inducing.  Dark blue or dark red
  on black are almost imposible to read. 
+ I've fixed a few faces by hand, but ideally I should try loading a
  different color theme.  I think that was a bit fiddly in emacs 23



*** Conflicts with Karabiner
+ I have some system-wide emacs-like keybindings set up with Karabiner
+ These conflict with the idea of running emacs inside a terminal
  inside a browser, since they get trapped at a higher level and never
  get seen by emacs
+ At the moment, I am just deactivating Karabiner while I use
  PythonEverywhere
+ In the future I could set up an exception for Chrome in the config
